      <p>
        Joshua O'Halloran is a full time student, full time worker, and a full time explorer. I spend most of my time
        inquiring about things from minds much more experienced and much more talented
        than my own.

        I attend Temple University's Information Science & Technology program, for a Bachelor's of Science. <br> I'll be
        graduating in May 2025. During my tenure at Temple I have maintained a 3.3 GPA
        and enjoyed a thorough education in programming fundamentals. My education has been primarly geared towards full
        stack web application development, OOP, and web design
        with multiple languages and frameworks including C#, Java, Javascript, React, .NET, SQL, Python, Django, Kotlin,
        and JetPack.
